# cubtest
A portable open source testframework for c

Cubtest ist derived from the urgent need for a C-Testframework for
the Cubesat currently under development by the TU Darmstadt Spacetechnology e. v..

After testing available open source solutions the restrictions based on the (unique)
enviornment made it clear that a new one was needed.

Combined with our strict open source (& knowledge) philosophy it was decided to outsource 
the framework into a separate project and as such make it available for others under GPL v3.

Cubtest is ment to provide a simple and usable approach to the problem of testing in c
especially on embedded plattforms as CubeSats and alike.

Q: Sure, but what can it do ?

It can:

- Provide a wide variaty of assert Funktions
- Provide basic scheme for reports of testruns
- Make it easier to use problem specific automation solutions

And most importend of all 

- Be easy to adapt to your project


Within example you can find a simple demonstrator that can be run on a desktop pc.
