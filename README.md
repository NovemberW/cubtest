# cubtest
A portable open source testframework for c

Cubtest ist derived from the urgent need for a C-Testframework for
the Cubesat currently under development by the TU Darmstadt Spacetechnology e. v. (http://tudsat.space/).

After evaluating available open source solutions we found it to be more easy to write a new one for our cubesat.

Combined with our strict open source (& knowledge) philosophy it was decided to outsource 
the framework into a separate project and as such make it available for others under GPL v3.

Cubtest is ment to provide a very simple and usable approach to the problem of testing in c
especially on embedded plattforms such as CubeSats and alike.

Q: Sure, but what can it do ?

It can:

- Provide a wide variaty of assert Funktions
- Provide basic scheme for reports of testruns
- Make it easier to use problem specific automation solutions

And most importend of all 

- Be easy to adapt to your project


Within example you can find a simple demonstrator that can be run on a desktop pc.
